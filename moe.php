		<p class="info">Drasti Jain is a 3rd year Law student at Government Law College, Mumbai. The first time she actually did an MUN was in the 5th grade, when her Social Studies teacher made them simulate the UN to better learn about the organisation and as a young student that had a huge impact on her. She learnt that we can actually make a change and being aware of the problem is the first step towards coming to a solution, and that is exactly the kind of opportunity MUNs provide us with, which she hopes will be replicated here. She welcomes all the delegates and wishes them good luck for the conference!

		<p class="info">Aditya is a second year student of law at Government Law College, Mumbai. Being an exception to the usual saying, he is a jack and master of all. His attention to detail and perfection in execution makes him bring nothing but solutions to the table. Dont confuse his jovial face for innocence, he has a lot of eccentricities behind his smile!
